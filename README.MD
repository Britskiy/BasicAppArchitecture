## Project Architecture Implementation Guide

# üèõ Project Architecture - A Relic of the Past
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning!** This project is an artifact of the past, preserved only as a tribute to my coding history. Proceed with caution! üöß

Once, this project was a beacon of structure and discipline in the chaotic world of backend development. Today, however, it stands as a **legacy monument**, a testament to a time before the elegance of **NestJS**.

## üíÄ Why Resurrect the Past?
I've updated the libraries, but let's be honest‚Äîthis is more of a **nostalgic challenge** than a practical necessity.  
The code still breathes (barely), but the world has moved on. **And so should you!**

## üöÄ A Call to Arms: Migrate to NestJS!
If you're here looking for inspiration, let me save you some time:  
‚ú® **Use [NestJS](https://nestjs.com)** instead.  
NestJS has already solved the issues I tried to address in this project, and does it **better, faster, stronger**.

But if you're feeling **brave** (or just love archeology), feel free to dive into this historical codebase. Just don't say I didn't warn you. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

This example represents one possible implementation of a business logic layer, and serve as the starting point in the training of forming the project structure.

**Why "attempt" and not the final realization?**

Because the goal of all projects are different, as well as a vision of business issues every developer involved in the project.

### How it works?

The first thing to understand is that there are several so-called layers of your project. I see the project in the following interpretations:
- **¬´Service layer¬ª** - the layer which handles the incoming data from the user and generates the necessary answer script as a result of mining
- **¬´Business Layer¬ª** - layer which is responsible for a particular function, and does not know anything about the data that actually have been received from the user or from other sources.
- **¬´Data layer¬ª** - is responsible for specific transactions are allowed for the current model (table), for example basic CRUD.

### And why do I need this?
This separation helps to better structure your code and avoid piling up logic.
Consider this example: user registration. Suppose we have a REST request from a user-defined fields, for simplicity we take the login / password. In this case, the layers will have the following roles:
- **Service layer** - forming data validity checking username, password as the text values (or other criteria) to clean debris from the data and generate a request to the business layer.
- **Business layer** - must obtain the "entrance", "clean" data manipulation to spend with them and call the model methods.
- **Data layer** just manages preservation / creation and other methods and do not know anything about the data itself.

*Summarize it in a VERY simplified form*<br />
**Service layer**: clears the data and generates a response from the business layer. <br />
**Business layer**: performs all data manipulation: the criterion sampling, filters and other "business objectives". <br />
**Data layer**: performs CRUD operations so that receives from business layer. <br />

In this embodiment, the *service layer* is *¬´controllers¬ª*, the *business layer* is *¬´repositories¬ª* and *data layer is ¬´models¬ª*
## Used libs

## Contributors

This code is implemented model of the user including the CRUD operations and authorization based on token jwt and of course it is accompanied by tests.
Good luck!
